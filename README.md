# Simple Python script to slice Cisco config and export via SSH to another device

## Features
- Script is useful for device config migration / replication

### Assumptions
- Place a copy of "show running" text file in the src_cfg folder
- Update environment.env file with your device ip & credentials
- Update trunks.py file to indiciate which sections of the source runconfig will be extracted
- Sample trunks.py file includes Cisco 9800 Wireless Lan Controller "configlets":
"Wireless Policy Tag", "Wireless Site Tag", "Flex Profile", "Static AP MAC address mappings"
- This script is useful when you have to replicate a large operational WLC configuration to N+1 controller

## Sample Cisco 9800 WLC config extraction
```
TRUNKS =  [
			'wireless tag policy',
			'wireless tag site',
			'wireless profile flex',
			'ap\s+([a-z0-9]{4}.[a-z0-9]{4}.[a-z0-9]{4})'
			]
```
